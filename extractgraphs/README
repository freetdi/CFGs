This directory contains some tools used to extract the control-flow-graphs from source code.

Most graphs can be reextracted by simply invocing "make". However , (see problems below.

This will build various C source files with the SDCC using the --dump-graphs option.
Most interesting are problably the control-flow graphs from register allocation. Their filenames are <file>.dumpralloccfg_<function>.dot

Problems:

Graphs from Coremark and FUZIX are not extracted by a simple "make", due to the issues below. They can be extracted by invocing "make graphs/coremark" and "make graphs/fuzix".

* Coremark is non-free, you have to get the source manually first (see also coremark/Makefile)
* FUZIX needs write access to /opt to build

For Atomthreads and FUZIX, source code is downloaded before the build. Read access to GitHub is needed.
