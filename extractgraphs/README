This directory contains some tools used to extract the control-flow-graphs from source code.

The graphs can be reextracted by invocing "make". However the Makefile in this directory is by itself not very useful (see problems below).

This will build various C source files with the SDCC using the --dump-graphs option.
Most interesting are problably the control-flow graphs from register allocation. Their filenames are <file>.dumpralloccfg_<function>.dot

Problems:
* Coremark in non-free, you have to get the source elsewhere
* FUZIX needs write access to /opt to build
* NuttX is very complicated to build
