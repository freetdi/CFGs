This repository containes control-flow graphs of
various C functions. The control-flow graphs were obtained
from the iCode in the sdcc compiler [1] by compiling, the
SDCC standard C library from the SDCC 3.7.0 release, a C
version of the floating-point benchmark Whetstone [2], an
ISO C version of version 2 of the integer benchmark Dhrys-
tone [3], the integer benchmark Coremark [4], version 0.5
of stdcbench version 2.5 of the operating system Contiki
[5] and the operating systems FUZIX, NuttX, Atomthreads
(from the repositories as of 2017-10-19).
