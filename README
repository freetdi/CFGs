This repository containes control-flow graphs of
various C functions. The control-flow graphs were obtained
from the iCode in the sdcc compiler [1] by compiling, the
sdcc standard C library from the 3.5.0 sdcc release, a C
version of the floating-point benchmark Whetstone [2], an
ISO C version of version 2 of the integer benchmark Dhrys-
tone [3] and the integer benchmark Coremark [4], version
2.5 of the operating system Contiki [5] and the operating
system FUZIX (from the git repository as of 2015-01-08).
